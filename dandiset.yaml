description: The incorporation of novel information into the hippocampal network is
  likely be constrained by its innate architecture and internally generated activity
  patterns. However, the origin, organization, and consequences of such patterns remain
  poorly understood. Here, we show that hippocampal network dynamics are affected
  by sequential neurogenesis. We birthdated CA1 pyramidal neurons with in-utero electroporation
  over 4 embryonic days encompassing the peak of hippocampal neurogenesis, and compared
  their functional features in freely moving, adult mice. Neurons of the same birthdate
  displayed distinct connectivity, coactivity across brain states, and assembly dynamics.
  Same birthdate hippocampal neurons were topographically organized, in that anatomically
  clustered (<500µm) neurons exhibited overlapping spatial representations. Overall,
  the wiring and functional features of CA1 pyramidal neurons reflected a combination
  of birthdate and the rate of neurogenesis. These observations demonstrate that sequential
  neurogenesis in embryonic development shapes the preconfigured forms of adult network
  dynamics.
